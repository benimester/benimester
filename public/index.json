I was born on September 19, 2003. I grew up in a small city named Seini in Maramureș county. I have dual nationality: Hungarian and Romanian. My mother tongue is Hungarian, and I also speak Romanian. I continued my high school studies in Satu Mare, where I gathered my first computer science-related knowledge by studying in a class specialized in this field. For college, I was fortunate to start my studies at Babeș-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca. I am currently in my final year of my Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree.\nIn my free time, I’ve tried many activities, and some have stuck with me, such as hiking, coffee brewing, and gaming. There are still many things I want to try, and I hope I’ll get the chance.\n\u0026#x2728; Hobbies \u0026#x2615; Coffee Around the time I moved to Satu Mare for high school, I got into coffee drinking. It was so fun to discover the diversity of flavors. My friends and I found a coffee shop we really loved. I think this played the biggest role in my love for coffee: the vibe of sipping coffee in a cozy shop on a quiet morning. If anyone visits the city, I wholeheartedly recommend Artisan Coffee Shop. Everything about that place made my days better.\nWhen COVID-19 hit, I ordered a used espresso machine (DeLonghi Scultura) to prepare my beloved beverage at home. Experimenting with ratios and techniques was a lot of fun. In November 2024, after four years, I upgraded to a DeLonghi Dedica Maestro Plus. While it has many automated functions, it remains a manual espresso machine with great customizability.\n\u0026#x1f3ae; Gaming My gaming journey began with a Nintendo GameBoy Advanced. The console had no backlight and was powered by two AA batteries. I had three games: Tetris, FIFA 98, and an action shooter. Tetris was my favorite until I got my first phone. Not because I played mobile games, but because I started watching gameplays on YouTube. My early favorite was Minecraft, and later I discovered the TheVR Hungarian gaming channel. I learned a lot from them—not just about games but also about the IT industry.\nWhen I was about 16, I got my first gaming laptop: an Asus TUF Gaming with an NVIDIA GTX 1080 graphics card and an Intel i7 7th generation processor. I played a lot of Minecraft and Tom Clancy\u0026rsquo;s Rainbow Six Siege. After finishing high school, I upgraded to an Asus ROG Flow Z13, which could handle more demanding games. That’s when I got into story-driven titles like Tomb Raider series, Assassin\u0026rsquo;s Creed Origins and Valhalla, Ark: Survival Evolved, and Hogwarts Legacy. Now, I’m saving up for a desktop PC to achieve better performance and play games like Cyberpunk and the latest Assassin\u0026rsquo;s Creed titles.\n\u0026#x1f41a; \u0026#x2b50; Dinos \u0026amp; Space These fascinations date back to my childhood. I don’t think I need to explain why—they\u0026rsquo;re just timeless. I still have a constant interest in these topics and love consuming related content.\n\u0026#x1f5fb; Hiking As a child, my family often took me on hiking trips and mushroom-picking adventures in the forest. Sometimes, we still venture out to find edible mushrooms. When I got older, I started organizing my own hiking trips. My most memorable achievement so far is climbing Pietrosul Mare Mountain in Muntii Rodnei, Borsa. It was an 8–9 hour trek, with the highest peak reaching 2,303 meters. I hope I’ll remember to update this section with future adventures.\n\u0026#x1f3b5; Vinyl I have a small collection of vinyl records. Most of them are jazz \u0026amp; blues EPs, \u0026rsquo;80s–\u0026rsquo;90s rock music, and Imagine Dragons, which is my favorite band. This hobby pairs perfectly with brewing a fresh cup of coffee in the morning.\n\u0026#x1f6e0;\u0026#xfe0f; DIY I enjoy doing basic repairs around the house. How much I can do usually depends on which power tools are available. I also like creative projects, such as building a poster wall in my room, sketching, or crafting ornamental trees out of wires and wood.\n","permalink":"https://benimester.github.io/about/general/","summary":"General introduction","title":"General"}]
