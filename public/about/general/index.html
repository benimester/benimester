I was born on September 19, 2003. I grew up in a small city named Seini in Maramure»ô county. I have dual nationality: Hungarian and Romanian. My mother tongue is Hungarian, and I also speak Romanian. I continued my high school studies in Satu Mare, where I gathered my first computer science-related knowledge by studying in a class specialized in this field. For college, I was fortunate to start my studies at Babe»ô-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca. I am currently in my final year of my Bachelor‚Äôs degree.\nIn my free time, I‚Äôve tried many activities, and some have stuck with me, such as hiking, coffee brewing, and gaming. There are still many things I want to try, and I hope I‚Äôll get the chance.\n‚ú® Hobbies ‚òï Coffee Around the time I moved to Satu Mare for high school, I got into coffee drinking. It was so fun to discover the diversity of flavors. My friends and I found a coffee shop we really loved. I think this played the biggest role in my love for coffee: the vibe of sipping coffee in a cozy shop on a quiet morning. If anyone visits the city, I wholeheartedly recommend Artisan Coffee Shop. Everything about that place made my days better.\nWhen COVID-19 hit, I ordered a used espresso machine (DeLonghi Scultura) to prepare my beloved beverage at home. Experimenting with ratios and techniques was a lot of fun. In November 2024, after four years, I upgraded to a DeLonghi Dedica Maestro Plus. While it has many automated functions, it remains a manual espresso machine with great customizability.\nüéÆ Gaming My gaming journey began with a Nintendo GameBoy Advanced. The console had no backlight and was powered by two AA batteries. I had three games: Tetris, FIFA 98, and an action shooter. Tetris was my favorite until I got my first phone. Not because I played mobile games, but because I started watching gameplays on YouTube. My early favorite was Minecraft, and later I discovered the TheVR Hungarian gaming channel. I learned a lot from them‚Äînot just about games but also about the IT industry.\nWhen I was about 16, I got my first gaming laptop: an Asus TUF Gaming with an NVIDIA GTX 1080 graphics card and an Intel i7 7th generation processor. I played a lot of Minecraft and Tom Clancy‚Äôs Rainbow Six Siege. After finishing high school, I upgraded to an Asus ROG Flow Z13, which could handle more demanding games. That‚Äôs when I got into story-driven titles like Tomb Raider series, Assassin‚Äôs Creed Origins and Valhalla, Ark: Survival Evolved, and Hogwarts Legacy. Now, I‚Äôm saving up for a desktop PC to achieve better performance and play games like Cyberpunk and the latest Assassin‚Äôs Creed titles.\nüêö ‚≠ê Dinos \u0026 Space These fascinations date back to my childhood. I don‚Äôt think I need to explain why‚Äîthey‚Äôre just timeless. I still have a constant interest in these topics and love consuming related content.\nüóª Hiking As a child, my family often took me on hiking trips and mushroom-picking adventures in the forest. Sometimes, we still venture out to find edible mushrooms. When I got older, I started organizing my own hiking trips. My most memorable achievement so far is climbing Pietrosul Mare Mountain in Muntii Rodnei, Borsa. It was an 8‚Äì9 hour trek, with the highest peak reaching 2,303 meters. I hope I‚Äôll remember to update this section with future adventures.\nüéµ Vinyl I have a small collection of vinyl records. Most of them are jazz \u0026 blues EPs, ‚Äô80s‚Äì‚Äô90s rock music, and Imagine Dragons, which is my favorite band. This hobby pairs perfectly with brewing a fresh cup of coffee in the morning.\nüõ†Ô∏è DIY I enjoy doing basic repairs around the house. How much I can do usually depends on which power tools are available. I also like creative projects, such as building a poster wall in my room, sketching, or crafting ornamental trees out of wires and wood.\n","wordCount":"669","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://benimester.github.io/about/general/borsa.jpg","datePublished":"2024-12-19T23:12:44+02:00","dateModified":"2024-12-19T23:12:44+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Beniamin Demeter"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://benimester.github.io/about/general/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Beniamin's Website","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://benimester.github.io/logo.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://benimester.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://benimester.github.io/me.jpg alt aria-label=logo height=30>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://benimester.github.io/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://benimester.github.io/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://benimester.github.io/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://benimester.github.io/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">General</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-12-19 23:12:44 +0200 EET'>December 19, 2024</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;Beniamin Demeter</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager src=https://benimester.github.io/borsa.jpg alt="Me staring at a landscape"><p><em>Pietrosul Mare Mountain - Muntii Rodnei, Borsa, Romania</em></p></figure><div class=post-content><h2 id=information_source-intro>&#8505;&#xfe0f; Intro<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#information_source-intro>#</a></h2><p>Hey, my name is Beniamin Demeter.
